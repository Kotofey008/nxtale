## ❓ What is this?

**Undertale 2.3** (a.k.a. **NXtale**) is an unofficial remake of the original **UNDERTALE**, rewritten from scratch in **GameMaker Studio 2.3+**.
This project was created for educational and research purposes — to better understand UNDERTALE's internal logic and to provide a base for modifications and fan content.

⚠️ *This project contains bugs, unstable features, and chaotic code — you've been warned!*

## ✨ Features

* ✅ Core UNDERTALE logic ported to GMS 2.3+
* ✏️ Additional content (some canon, some not-so-much)
* 🐞 Lots of bugs (some even intentional!)
* 🔧 Actively being reworked (and rewritten... again)

## 📦 Requirements

* **GameMaker Studio 2024.2.0.132** or newer
* Basic experience with GML (GameMaker Language)

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Undertale-2.3.git
   ```
2. Open the project in GMS **2024.2.0.132+**
   *(Stability is NOT guaranteed on earlier versions!)*
3. Build and run the project for your target platform
